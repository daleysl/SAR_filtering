# SAR_filtering
Abstract
The goal of this paper is to filter Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) using two different methods. The first method being Haar Wavelet Transforms, and the second method being Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We consider two different reasons to do so: which is easier as a human to see, and for putting the filtered image into a deep learning model channel for future work on image classification.

Data
SAR images used were from Sandia National Laboratories

To read in .gff files we followed code outlined in `Matlab_GFF_viewer.pdf'
